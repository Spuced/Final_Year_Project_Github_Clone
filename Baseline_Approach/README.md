# Baseline Approach

Here you'll find our baseline approaches for machine classification of exosomes based on their Raman spectra

The notebooks in this folder will outline how we:

- Clean the spectra

- Visualise different samples

- Investigate feature importance

- Explore peak feature engineering

- Compare model performance

Everything in this notebook is evaluated using KFold cross-validation
