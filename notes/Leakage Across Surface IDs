It appears that when spectra from the same surface ID are contained within both the training and testing folds of the cross-validation, data is leaked to the model about the status of the spectrum.

Leave P Groups Out and Group K fold can ensure that this cross-contamination does not occur, giving a better evaluation of the model's ability to generalise.
