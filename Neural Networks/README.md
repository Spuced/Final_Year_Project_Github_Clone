### **Neural Networks**

This folder contains some attempts to classify the spectra using neural approaches.

Both randomly shuffled and surface based splits are explored.

Unfortunately the model architecture used by [Shin et al](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsnano.9b09119). is not publicly available.

However they did outline a smaller [CNN](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsnano.9b09119/suppl_file/nn9b09119_si_001.pdf) that was claimed to achieve over 90% accuracy, which we have replicated using both data splitting approaches.
